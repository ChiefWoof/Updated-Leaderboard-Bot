### 3) The Bot's "/link" Command

<br>

In a Discord text channel, type "/link" and look for the bot's option. Then in the "user" parameter, type your GD username. Then send the command

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you are unable to find the command in the chat bar, it is most likely because either the bot does not have access to that text channel OR your Discord app needs to be updated. You may need to switch to a different text channel or configure the bot's channel permissions

<br>

### 4) Sending the Link Message

<br>

On the bot's response, you'll see a message subject and a message content procedure. The bot will ask you to send woofBot a message with the subject "Link" and a code (for this example, it's "s2kEPQba") for the message content

On GD, type "Link" into the message subject and the code (in this example, "s2kEPQba") into the message content

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The message subject and content ARE CASE-SENSITIVE. This means you should NOT add any extra spaces or characters, or make any changes from what's directed

<br>

Once completed, use the send button

<br>

### 5) Completing the Process

<br>

After sending the message on GD, go back to Discord and use the "Done" button

<br>

Your GD account is now linked with your Discord account on the bot
