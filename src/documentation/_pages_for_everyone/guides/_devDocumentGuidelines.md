# Document Creation Guidelines
Documentation process

## General
* With the exception of the primary "readme.md" document, documents should never use acronyms or directly use the title of the bot or the group behind it (as to date: "Updated Leaderboard" / "UL")
* Majority of paragraphs and sentences should never end with a period unless a quotation (that has a period) or if a period makes it look "better" to viewers

## Documents Created for Discord Viewers
* The total <u>visible</u> characters that follow \#-\#^3 headers should never exceed 32 (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
* Whenever there's text or an image above a \#-\#^3 header, there should always be a [line break](#discord-line-breaks) above the header to create space
* Whenever text sits between two distinct, large images, a [line break](#discord-line-breaks) should be put above and below the text

## Utility

### Discord Line Breaks
This should done by putting "\_ \_" in the message
