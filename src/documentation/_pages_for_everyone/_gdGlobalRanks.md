## What it is

A player's global rank is determined by their position in the official in-game top stars. As of date, this leaderboard is split into two sections: the Top 1000 Leaderboard and Global Leaderboard

### Rank Bans

When a user a rank banned by a in-game leaderboard mod, they are removed from the global leaderboard and are prevented from being able to rejoin the section until the ban is lifted. The user's profile appears like any other unranked user. The global rank will not be displayed on the profile (showing as 0 in the code)

> [!CAUTION]  
> If you are experiencing ranking issues, have concerns, or just need general support, you can join the official GD leaderboard Discord server ([here](https://discord.gg/PwdrGesHC6)) to find additional resources and ask for help

### Global Leaderboard

This is the first official rank section. Since it's creation, it has been adjusted to only rank players from 1001+, inclusively. Players are able to join this section after reaching 500 stars. Addition to this section is done when it is refreshed which is done <u>manually by RobTop</u> usually within a 2-week period

### Top 1000 Leaderboard

This is the second official rank section that contains players from rank 1 - 1000, inclusively. It refreshes players hourly. It is manually managed by the in-game leaderboard mods
